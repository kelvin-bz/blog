I have known Dragon Ball since I was a child. Back then, I dreamed of being a character who could help Goku in his battles. I still have this habit as an adult when I have trouble sleeping. The fight with Frieza, the first time I saw Goku turn Super Saiyan â€“ those moments are forever in my mind.


Enjoy this touching tribute to Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball. The song is called "Gone Too Soon" by [ANIMETRIX](https://www.youtube.com/@AnimetrixWAV).
