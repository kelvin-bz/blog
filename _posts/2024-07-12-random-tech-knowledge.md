## Security Vulnerabilities
### Cors

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin. A web application makes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, and port) than its own origin.

For example a client from `http://domain-a.com` makes a request to `http://domain-b.com`. The browser will block the request unless the server at `http://domain-b.com` sends the appropriate headers to allow the request.

```mermaid
graph 
subgraph browserClient["Browser (http://domain-a.com)"]
  preflightRequest["fa:fa-plane-departure Preflight Request"]
  actualRequest["fa:fa-paper-plane Actual Request"]
end

subgraph apiServer["API Server (http://domain-b.com)"]
  preflightRequest --> originAllowed["Origin: http://domain-a.com Allowed?"]
  originAllowed -->|Yes| methodAllowed["Method: POST Allowed?"]
  methodAllowed -->|Yes| headersAllowed["Header: X-Custom-Header Allowed?"]
  headersAllowed -->|Yes| preflightResponse["fa:fa-reply Preflight Response"]
  actualRequest["Resource Access"] --> response["fa:fa-reply Response"]
end

classDef browserClient fill:#f8f9fa,stroke:#dae0e5,color:#212529;
classDef apiServer fill:#e2e3e5,stroke:#adb5bd,color:#212529;


```

### CSRF
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. The user is authenticated. The attacker tricks the user into clicking a link or visiting a page that contains a hidden request.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Attacker as ü¶π Attacker
    participant Victim as üë§ Victim's Browser
    participant Bank as üè¶ Bank

    Attacker->>Victim: Sends malicious link/email
    Note right of Victim: User clicks the link/visits page
    Victim->>Bank: Sends forged request with credentials
    Note left of Bank: Authenticated request<br/>appears legitimate
    Bank-->>Victim: Response (e.g., action confirmation)
    Bank-->>Attacker: Performs action (e.g., money transfer)

    Note over Attacker,Bank: CSRF Attack Completed

```

To prevent CSRF attacks, use CSRF tokens. A CSRF token is a unique, random value that is generated for each user session. It is included in the form or request and validated by the server to ensure that the request is legitimate. 
 
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Attacker as ü¶π Attacker
    participant Victim as üë§ Victim's Browser
    participant Bank as üè¶ Bank

    Note over Attacker: Step 1: Preparation
    Attacker->>Victim: Sends malicious link/email
    Note right of Victim: User clicks the link/visits page

    Note over Victim,Bank: Step 2: Token Protected Request
    Victim->>Bank: Requests protected page/form
    Bank-->>Victim: Sends page with CSRF token

    Note over Victim: Step 3: Submitting the Form (Legitimate Request)
    Victim->>Bank: Submits form with CSRF token
    Bank->>Bank: Validates CSRF token
    Bank-->>Victim: Responds with success

    Note over Attacker,Victim: Step 4: Forged Request (Attack)
    Victim->>Bank: Sends forged request without valid CSRF token
    Bank->>Bank: Validates CSRF token
    Bank-->>Victim: Responds with CSRF validation failed
```


### XSS

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can be used to steal sensitive information, such as cookies, or to perform actions on behalf of the user.

Types of XSS attacks: Stored XSS, Reflected XSS, DOM-based XSS.

The immpact of XSS attacks can be severe, including data theft, session hijacking, and defacement of websites.

```mermaid
graph 
 attacker["fa:fa-user-secret Attacker"]
 subgraph server["fa:fa-server server"]
 style server stroke-width:2px
  script1["fa:fa-code script"]
   sanitization["fa:fa-soap sanitization"]
 end
 
 subgraph browswer["fa:fa-computer browswer"]
  contentSecurityPolicy["üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CSP"]
  subgraph url["fa:fa-chain url"]
  style url fill:#eeffee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
  script2["fa:fa-code script"]
 end

  subgraph dom["fa:fa-tree dom"]
 style dom fill:#eeffee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
  script3["fa:fa-code script"]
 end
 end 


```

To prevent XSS attacks, you should always sanitize user input and escape output. You can also use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources of content that can be loaded on your page.

## Cookies And Sessions

Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored in the browser. They are sent to the server with every request. Sessions are server-side storage of user data. The session ID is stored in the cookie and is used to retrieve the session data from the server.

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph browser["fa:fa-computer browser"]
    style browser  stroke-width:2px
    subgraph cookie["üç™ Cookie "]
        style cookie fill:#eeffee, stroke-width:2px
        sessionId
    end
  end

  subgraph server2["fa:fa-server server"]
    style server2  stroke-width:2px
    session["üìÅ  Session Storage"]
  end

  cookie <-.-> |üç™|server2

  
```

## System Reliability
###  Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components. It is commonly achieved by redundancy, which means that the system has multiple copies of critical components so that if one fails, another can take over.

```mermaid
graph TD
    
    
   
    subgraph errorHandling["üìÅ Error Handling"]
      errorDetection["fa:fa-bug Error Detection"]
      errorRecovery["fa:fa-tools Error Recovery"]
      errorDetection --> |"Detects errors"|errorRecovery
    end

 subgraph failover["üìÅ Failover"]
      primarySystem["fa:fa-hdd Primary System"]
      backupSystem["fa:fa-hdd Backup System"]
      primarySystem --> |"Switches to secondary if primary fails"|backupSystem
    end

    subgraph redundancy["üìÅ Redundancy"]
      primaryComponent["fa:fa-server Primary Component"]
      secondaryComponent["fa:fa-server Secondary Component"]
      primaryComponent --> |"Monitors and takes over if primary fails"|secondaryComponent
    end

    style redundancy fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
    style failover fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008 
```

### High Availability

High availability is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly for a long period of time without interruption. It is commonly achieved by redundancy, load balancing, and failover mechanisms.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph loadBalancing["üìÅ Load Balancing"]
      request["fa:fa-paper-plane Request"]
      loadBalancer["fa:fa-balance-scale Load Balancer"]
      server1["fa:fa-server Server 1"]
      server2["fa:fa-server Server 2"]
      server3["fa:fa-server Server 3"]
      request --> |"Distributes requests"|loadBalancer
      loadBalancer --> |"Routes requests to servers"|server1
      loadBalancer --> |"Routes requests to servers"|server2
      loadBalancer --> |"Routes requests to servers"|server3
    end

    subgraph failover["üìÅ Failover"]
      primarySystem["fa:fa-hdd Primary System"]
      backupSystem["fa:fa-hdd Backup System"]
      primarySystem --> |"Switches to secondary if primary fails"|backupSystem
    end

    subgraph redundancy["üìÅ Redundancy"]
      primaryComponent["fa:fa-server Primary Component"]
      secondaryComponent["fa:fa-server Secondary Component"]
      primaryComponent --> |"Monitors and takes over if primary fails"|secondaryComponent
    end

    style loadBalancing fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
    style failover fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
    style redundancy fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
```

### Scalability

Scalability is the property that enables a system to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to accommodate growth. It is commonly achieved by adding more resources, such as servers, to the system.



## Cryptography
### Hashing

Hashing is the process of converting an input (e.g. a password) into a fixed-length string of characters. Hash functions are deterministic, meaning that the same input will always produce the same output. They are also one-way, meaning that it is computationally infeasible to reverse the process and obtain the original input from the hash.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph hashingConcepts["fa:fa-road Hashing Concepts"]
    input["fa:fa-unlock-alt Password: 'password123'"] -->|Hashing Algorithm| hashOutput["fa:fa-lock Hash: 9f86d0...1343c"]
    hashOutput -.->|"fa:fa-ban Cannot be reversed"| input
end

style input fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
style hashOutput fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008

```

### Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting data into a form that is unreadable without the correct key. It is reversible, meaning that the original data can be recovered by decrypting the encrypted data with the key.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph encryptionConcepts["fa:fa-road Encryption Concepts"]
    input["fa:fa-unlock-alt Plaintext: 'Hello, World!'"] -->|Encryption Algorithm| encryptedOutput["fa:fa-lock Ciphertext: 'U2FsdGVkX1+...Q=="]
    encryptedOutput -.->|"fa:fa-key Decryption Key"| input

    style input fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
    style encryptedOutput fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
end
```

## System Design

### Event-Driven Architecture
Event-driven architecture is a software design pattern that promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. It is commonly used to build scalable, loosely coupled systems.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph eventDriven["fa:fa-road Event-Driven Concepts"]
    eventProducer["fa:fa-bell Event Producer"] -->|Publish Event| eventBus["fa:fa-bus Event Bus"]
    eventBus -->|Subscribe Event| eventConsumer["fa:fa-user Event Consumer"]
end
style eventProducer fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
style eventConsumer fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
```

### Pub/Sub
Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) is a messaging pattern where senders of messages (publishers) do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers (subscribers). Instead, the messages are published to topics, without knowledge of what (if any) subscribers there may be.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph pubSub["fa:fa-road Pub/Sub Concepts"]
    publisher["fa:fa-bell Publisher"] -->|Publish Message| topic["fa:fa-book Topic"]
    topic -->|Subscribe| subscriber["fa:fa-user Subscriber"]
end
style publisher fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
style subscriber fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
```

### Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is a technique used to control the rate of traffic sent or received by a network interface. It is commonly used to prevent abuse of an API by limiting the number of requests that can be made in a given time period.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph rateLimiting["fa:fa-road Rate Limiting Concepts"]
    request["fa:fa-paper-plane Request"] -->|Rate Limiting Algorithm| rateLimitCheck["fa:fa-stopwatch Rate Limit Check"]
    rateLimitCheck -->|Allowed| response["fa:fa-reply Response"]
    rateLimitCheck -->|Exceeded| errorResponse["fa:fa-exclamation-triangle Error Response"]
end
style request fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
style response fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
style errorResponse fill:#f8d7da,stroke:#d73e68
```

### Load Balancing

Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers. It is commonly used to improve the performance, reliability, and scalability of web applications.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph loadBalancing["fa:fa-road Load Balancing Concepts"]
    request["fa:fa-paper-plane Request"] -->|Load Balancing Algorithm| serverSelection["fa:fa-server Server Selection"]
    serverSelection -->|Selected Server| response["fa:fa-reply Response"]
end
style request fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
style response fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
```

## WebHooks
Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events. They are commonly used to integrate external services with web applications.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph webhooks["fa:fa-road Webhooks Concepts"]
    event["fa:fa-bell Event"] -->|Webhook Trigger| webhook["fa:fa-link Webhook"]
    webhook -->|HTTP Request| externalService["fa:fa-cloud External Service"]
end
style event fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
style externalService fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
```

## Caching
Caching is the process of storing copies of data in a cache to reduce the time it takes to access the data. It is commonly used to improve the performance of web applications by reducing the load on the server.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph caching["fa:fa-road Caching Concepts"]
    request["fa:fa-paper-plane Request"] -->|Cache Lookup| cacheHit["fa:fa-check Cache Hit"]
    cacheHit -->|Found| response["fa:fa-reply Response"]
    cacheHit -->|Not Found| serverResponse["fa:fa-server Server Response"]
end
style request fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
style response fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
style serverResponse fill:#f8d7da,stroke:#d73e68
```

## Indexing
Indexing is the process of creating an index for a database table to improve the speed of data retrieval. It is commonly used to optimize the performance of database queries.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph indexing["fa:fa-road Indexing Concepts"]
    query["fa:fa-search Query"] -->|Index Lookup| indexHit["fa:fa-check Index Hit"]
    indexHit -->|Found| response["fa:fa-reply Response"]
    indexHit -->|Not Found| tableScan["fa:fa-table Table Scan"]
end
style query fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
style response fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
style tableScan fill:#f8d7da,stroke:#d73e68
```

## OAuth
OAuth is an open standard for access delegation that is commonly used for authentication and authorization. It allows a user to grant a third-party application access to their resources without sharing their credentials.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph oauth["fa:fa-road OAuth Concepts"]
    user["fa:fa-user User"] -->|Authorization Request| authorizationServer["fa:fa-server Authorization Server"]
    authorizationServer -->|Authorization Grant| thirdPartyApp["fa:fa-cloud Third-Party App"]
end
style user fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
style thirdPartyApp fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
```

## Queues
A queue is a data structure that stores elements in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. It is commonly used to manage the flow of data between different parts of a system.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph queues["fa:fa-road Queue Concepts"]
    producer["fa:fa-bell Producer"] -->|Enqueue| queue["fa:fa-box Queue"]
    queue -->|Dequeue| consumer["fa:fa-user Consumer"]
end
style producer fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
style consumer fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
```

## Zero Trust Security
Zero Trust Security is a security model that assumes that threats exist both inside and outside the network. It requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources on the network.

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph zeroTrust["fa:fa-road Zero Trust Concepts"]
    user["fa:fa-user User"] -->|Identity Verification| identityProvider["fa:fa-id-card Identity Provider"]
    identityProvider -->|Access Control| resource["fa:fa-database Resource"]
end
style user fill:#cce5ee,stroke:#008
style resource fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#008
```
